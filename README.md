# Covid-19-Community-Crosswalk
This research aims to assess the prevalence of covid-19 in the regions of US. The US
healthcare and economy has been battered and will leave a heavy impact in due time considering
the variants in play. Since it is a contagious disease, it spreads like wildfire given a particular
locality. In order to minimalize the widespread of covid-19 and to provide adequate healthcare
and awareness among the people, the research strives to differentiate highly affected areas with
the lesser ones based on factors such as Hardest Hit Areas, Low Income Area Scores, Rural
Scores, etc. Future vulnerabilities for the Tribal, Partially Tribal, and Non-tribal Communities
can be evaluated and used in healthcare policy making based on this research.
Main objective of this project is to analyze the dataset and gain insights from the visualizations
and statistics about the vulnerabilities of the affected regions as well as the communities residing
there based on different scores in the dataset. This will help in procuring appropriate resources
for the population in such Hard-Hit Areas. Using the discussed dataset and its variables, this
research will answer the following research questions:
What locations had the highest and the lowest cumulative scores contributed to
their vulnerability?
What community of people experienced the hardest hit of all?
Individual score analysis for each state?
